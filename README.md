![deployedweatherapp](/Users/alizehassan/fuzzy-octo-enigma/weatherappimg.png)
In the Application the user wishes to see the current weather forecast as well as the 5 day future forecast for the identified city. When the user searches a city the lon and lat are pulled from the geocode api and then put into the the open weatherapi pull in order to query the results from the search city. the call was then looped in order to retrieve the 5 day forecast. These events were then stored in local storage. In addition functionality to click on a past search and display said data was created.
